## Data Files
Download all three CSV files:

1) [OpenTable data, unpivoted](https://github.com/ideaOwl/betacityyeg-dive-opentable/raw/main/data/unpivoted-opentable-seated-diner-data.csv)
2) [COVID-19 Alberta Statistics](https://github.com/ideaOwl/betacityyeg-dive-opentable/raw/main/data/covid-19-alberta-statistics-summary-data.csv)
3) [Timetable of Alberta Actions on COVID-19](https://github.com/ideaOwl/betacityyeg-dive-opentable/raw/main/data/covid-19-pandemic-response-alberta.csv)


> **Note:** Data was gathered at various dates, mainly in January/February 2022, from [1. OpenTable's State of the Industry dataset](https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry), [2. Alberta Government's COVID-19 Statistics (summary data)](https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#data-export), and excerpts from a [3. Wikipedia article on the timeline of the pandemic in Alberta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_Alberta) I summarized.

## Background

Originally created for a [BetaCity Learn/Data-thon](https://www.meetup.com/startupedmonton/events/283522699/) to use OpenTable data to compare in-person dining reservations before and after the pandemic began.
